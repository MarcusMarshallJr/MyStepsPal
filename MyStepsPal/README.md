## Overview

MyStepsPal is a super simple pedometer app. It uses CoreMotion's CMPedometer API to showcase a user's motion history for the past 7 days. The app's home screen provides simple visual progress and some quick encouragement to usher a user towards their step daily. 


## 👟 Daily Step Goal
As a user walks, they are given a live counter of their steps from the beginning of the day. By default, the app encourages each user to move at least 6,000 steps. Users can easily change their Daily Step Goal using a button on the Home Screen. This button presents a sheet to adjust how many steps the user intends to take each day.

## 🕐 Step History
Users can view the last 7 days, including today, of history provided by Core Motion. Tapping any day allows them to see a summary of their activity on that day. This summary includes the total number of steps, distance moved, and stairs climbed.


## 😊 A Big Thank You
 Hi there! Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read over my code for the iOS Engineer position. I'm excited to share my solution to the project with the great folks at MyFitnessPal and I look forward to talking with you soon.
